# fun-with-gRPC

It happens that I want to use gRPC in my upcoming [DNS server](https://github.com/jgaa/nsblast).

I have used gRPC in the past - with great pain. This time around I looked at some examples and made 
kind of an implementation - but I realized it was crap. To add injury to insult, 
there were simply too many things I did not know or understand properly to fix it. 
So I decided to spend some time to play with gRPC to get a better understanding.

The code in this repository is primarily intended as examples used in a blog-series about 
gRPC and C++.
